This is a really good website to learn and progress through JAVA, it helped me learn new ideas and refresh on my old ones.

# Basics

1) Greeter was pretty straight forward. Just return the expected string.

2) Lasagna involved little manipulation of the passed in parameters.

# Booleans

1) I did this with a classic flow chart however it can be done a lot easier than I've implemented it. 
    https://github.com/airbuff/Exercism.io/blob/main/Java/AnnalynsInfiltration.java
    
    This is the flow chart I used and following the instructions it's pretty clear what it wants to pass your code.

While doing the exercises I realised completing one exercise in one section completes in another seciton too, thought that was pretty neat. (I might learn to do that relational entries??...)

# Strings

1) Reverse String is a method straight out of the library which was news to me. My implementation would've involved a array with the length of the input then spit the    values in the array in reverse order. But I found the method so, reiterating my point it's a good website.

2) Microblog this exercise has taught me the most so far, I researched Unicode and Codepoints which I thought were trivial and didn't give much thought to initially. I    found out storing different characters based on codepoints is the new standards and unicode determines the byte size. To do this one i initialised an array measured    its size using codepoint and followed the bouncing ball.
